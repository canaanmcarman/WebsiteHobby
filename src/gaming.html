<p>Hello, my name is Canaan and I have been a pro gamer since 2011. I am specialized in the FPS genre and the first game I really sunk a lot of hours into was Quake Live
<br>I never actually competed in Quake but every game I fell in love with and did end up competing in has had that same fast paced FPS feel inspired directly from Quake.</p>
After developing tendinitis in both arms I was forced to take an early break from the player side and focused on coaching for a few years, and that is where I am at now!

<h3>Favorite games (casual and competitive):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Teamfortress 2 (Professional)</li>
    <li>Overwatch (Professional)</li>
    <li>Quake Live</li>
    <li>Starcraft</li>
    <li>Street Fighter</li>



</ul>
